# Roboknight

A roguelike top-down video game in the style of the Binding of Isaac. Written in C# with the XNA video game development library.

## What is this?

This is my culminating project for my Grade 12 Computer Science course. I was tasked with developing a video game from the ground up using the XNA library in C#.

## Assets

While all code is original and most images are original, this project uses assets from *The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth* (2014), as well as from *The Legend of Zelda* (1986) and *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* (1991). I do not claim ownership over any of these borrowed assets. The images and sound files from *The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth* and *The Legend of Zelda* belong to their respective owners.

## Setup

I have tried countless times to get this software to run on Windows 10, using the Visual Studio IDE. However, it seems that XNA is no longer supported in the way that is required to compile this project. For this reason, I have no real instructions or advice for getting this to work.

If someone finds a way, don't hesitate to notify me. Godspeed, and good luck.

## Objective

You play the game by exploring the randomly-generated rooms and fighting the monsters found within. Find items in treasure rooms to boost your fighting power. Earn gold by slaying monsters to purchase additional items from the shop.

I wrote a more flavourful description as part of the original project submission. It is in the form of a mock handbook as you would find packaged with old games, in the file `Roboknight handbook.docx`.

## Original description

Shown below are the contents of the original `README.txt` which was submitted along with the assignment.

```
Welcome to the adventure of a lifetime!

Controls:
	Keyboard Controls
		W/A/S/D keys for movement
		Up/Down/Left/Right keys for firing projectiles
		Press Escape to toggle the pause menu
	XBox 360 Gamepad Controls
		Left Thumbstick for movement
		A/B/X/Y buttons for firing projectiles
		Press START to toggle the pause menu

NOTES:

Might be a bit loud, so it's best to start with your volume low.

The "Map" tab in the pause menu is empty. That isn't because you need to unlock it. I was not able to make a mapping system in the time I had after completing by objectives.

You are unable to navigate the Game-Over menu with the XBox controller. This is a bug.
