A roguelike top-down video game in the style of the Binding of Isaac. Written in C# with the XNA video game development library.

## What is this?

This is my culminating project for my Grade 12 Computer Science course. I was tasked with developing a video game from the ground up using the XNA library in C#.

## Assets

While all code is original and most images are original, this project uses assets from *The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth* (2014), as well as from *The Legend of Zelda* (1986) and *The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* (1991). I do not claim ownership over any of these borrowed assets. The images and sound files from *The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth* and *The Legend of Zelda* belong to their respective owners.

## Original description

Shown below are the contents of the original `README.txt` which was submitted along with the assignment.

```
Welcome to the adventure of a lifetime!

Controls:
	Keyboard Controls
		W/A/S/D keys for movement
		Up/Down/Left/Right keys for firing projectiles
		Press Escape to toggle the pause menu
	XBox 360 Gamepad Controls
		Left Thumbstick for movement
		A/B/X/Y buttons for firing projectiles
		Press START to toggle the pause menu

NOTES:

Might be a bit loud, so it's best to start with your volume low.

The "Map" tab in the pause menu is empty. That isn't because you need to unlock it. I was not able to make a mapping system in the time I had after completing by objectives.

You are unable to navigate the Game-Over menu with the XBox controller. This is a bug.
