Welcome to the adventure of a lifetime! (Just kidding this is just a bad Legend of Zelda clone)

Controls:
	Keyboard Controls
		W/A/S/D keys for movement
		Up/Down/Left/Right keys for firing projectiles
		Press Escape to toggle the pause menu
	XBox 360 Gamepad Controls
		Left Thumbstick for movement
		A/B/X/Y buttons for firing projectiles
		Press START to toggle the pause menu

NOTES:

Might be a bit loud, so it's best to start with your volume low.

The "Map" tab in the pause menu is empty. That isn't because you need to unlock it. I was not able to make a mapping system in the time I had after completing by objectives.

You are unable to navigate the Game-Over menu with the XBox controller. This is a bug.
